# LSAT_RaschModel
An implementation of the BUGS example LSAT: item response (http://www.openbugs.net/Examples/Lsat.html) on R. Parameters for the Rasch model are estimated using Maximum Marginal Likelihood as well as Bayesian Inference using jags and an implementation of Metropolis on R.
This work was done as my final project for the course of Statistical Methods in Data Science & Laboratory 2017 at La Sapienza - Universita di Roma.
